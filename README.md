# Nintendo Switch Controller Bot

Control your Nintendo switch using a Micro Controller Unit (MCU).
This setup focuses on having less necessary hardware and an easier setup.
Firmware uses Bluetooth to connect to the Console, while providing a Web Interface via WiFi for easy configuration.

This project utilizes a Real Time Operating System developed via the Zephyrproject.
The targeted board for this project is the ESP32.
